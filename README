About BitMail
-------------

https://launchpad.net/bitmail

The BitMail project is used to provide IMAP or POP services
along with SMTP service on top of the PyBitmessage project.
BitMail utilizes the PyBitmessage API.  BitMail provides SSL
encryption and listens on all interfaces.  It is designed to
run as a daemon via the --daemon option, but can provide
logging to the terminal when not run as a daemon.

BitMail expects a configuration file named bitmail.conf.
The configuration file is in JSON format.  The default
configuration directory is: /etc/bitmail.


Enable Access to the PyBitmessage API
-------------------------------------
You must add the following fields to your PyBitmessage
keys.dat file:

apienabled = true
apiport = 8442
apiinterface = 127.0.0.1
apiusername = [user]
apipassword = [password]
daemon = true

The keys.dat file is most likely located here:

~/.config/PyBitmessage/keys.dat

The should swap in your own user and password details.
The daemon field is optional.  Once you have the values
configured, you should place the apiport, apiinterface,
apiusername, and apipassword values into their respective
"BitMessage Port", "BitMessage Server", "BitMessage User",
and "BitMessage Password" fields in the bitmail.conf
configuration file.


Dependencies
------------
sudo apt-get install libbz2-dev libexpat1-dev libsmbclient-dev libssl-dev libtar-dev libxmlrpc-c3-dev zlib1g-dev


BitMail Installation Instructions
---------------------------------
Use the following commands to install BitMail:

bzr branch lp:bitmail
cd bitmail
make
sudo make install
make clean

If the "make" line complains about missing functions, that
means you will need to install the associated library
dependancy.

Among other things, the "sudo make install" command will
install the bitmail.conf file for use as an UPSTART
service.  It will also install a default bitmail.conf file
in the /etc/bitmail directory.  The default configuration
directory can be overriden using the --conf argument.

Here is an example of how to run bitmail from the
terminal and see the output messages:

sudo /usr/local/bin/bitmail

Here is an example of how to run bitmail from the
terminal with a custom configuration directory:

sudo /usr/local/bin/bitmail --conf=/some/other/dir

Here is an example of how to run bitmail in daemon mode:

sudo /usr/local/bin/bitmail --daemon

You can also see a usage statement using:

/usr/local/bin/bitmail --help


BitMail Update Instructions
---------------------------
